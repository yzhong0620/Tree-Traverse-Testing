# Overview

The goal of our project is to provide a platform for computer science students who are new to tree to check whether they fully understand the concepts of pre-order, in-order, and post-order traverse.\
The program generates three different types of trees: Complete, incomplete and full. One at a time, the user can view the trees in a separate window and 
click on each of the nodes. They can press them in any order they want. Then, the user can check to see if they have the correct traversal by pressing one of the buttons at the bottom of the screen and then pressing the check button.\
The program would then return the nodes in the correct order based off of the traversal and print it in the java terminal for the user to see. If the user messes up, they can try again and again until they get the correct order.\
Note/Limitation:
1. The user needs to click on the reset button to try again.
2. The user needs to be careful only clicking each button once or they won't be able to get it correct.
