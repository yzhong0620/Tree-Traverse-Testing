1. I hope to make the program automatically stop and check once all buttons are clicked. One problem is that I do not know how to disable a button once it has been clicked so that I can make sure every button is clicked and is clicked only once. This leads to one of our limitations that the user needs to be responsible that they click on every button and do not click on the same button twice.
2. I also hope to make the user able to switch between different trees. Now, because of the way of randomization we chose, once a tree is selected, the user can only perform different traversal for the same tree. They cannot switch to other trees unless they stop and rerun the program. To solve this problem, we need a new way of randomization but I cannot think of a better idea.

I am proud of our visualization of the tree by making buttons in a tree shape. I also like that we add in-order and post-order to the binary tree class which is provided in the tree activity and originally only has pre-order. It is satisfying to think that our program may help other comp sci students better understand the concepts of tree traversal as well.
